### Executive Summary
This project aims to predict apartment rental prices across major U.S. cities—such as Boston and Los Angeles—using regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and regularized methods (Ridge, Lasso). Our goal is to help international students identify affordable housing options by analyzing factors like location, apartment size, and amenities.  
We also apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to group cities or neighborhoods by affordability and quality of life. Evaluation metrics include RMSE, MAE, R² for regression and Silhouette Score for clustering. Geospatial analysis (using latitude and longitude) further highlights rental trends near universities.  
Our findings will offer practical insights into cost-effective living, guiding students and housing stakeholders in making informed, data-driven decisions.
